Test (2A): initial election ...
Server 0 started election for term 1.
RequestVote: server 2 grant vote to server 0. Reason: same term, log index is at least uptodate 
RequestVote: server 1 grant vote to server 0. Reason: same term, log index is at least uptodate 
sendRequestVote: Server 0 received vote for term 1 from 2
server 0 is now the leader for term 1.
